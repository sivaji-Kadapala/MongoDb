MongoDB
--------
-NoSQl Database
-use it anytime you want to store data and persist it in your app 
-mongo is the M in MEAN or MERN
Traditional Database
--------------------
-organized collectionof data
-notion of tables
-primary and foreign keys
-design schema
-ACID properties
-MS SQL server,Oracle Database,MySQL,IBM DB2
Limitations of RDBMS
---------------------
-Scalability
-Data Complexity
-Broken keys
-Define schema before load
what is NoSQl
--------------
-A form of database management system that is non-relational
-Term NSQL coined in 1998 by carlo Strozzi
-Data is more complex 
-Many NoSQl databases
-NoSQl is queries are focused on collection of documents.
NoSQl:mongoDb,Redis,casandra,HBase,Neo4J
why NoSQl
---------
-Non-relational/distributed database
-No schema required
-Auto Elasticity
-Integrateded caching 
-Simpler Data Model
Document based-MongoDB,Couchbase
key/value based-Redis,MemcacheD
column based:Cassandra,HBase
Graph based:OrientDB,Neo4J
RDBMS  VS MongoDB
-----------------
Database-Database
tables-collections
Rows-documents
columns-fields
join-Embed/Link documents
-->A single instance of mongo can hold multiple databases
-->Every doc has a special key "_id"-->unique to collection j
Document:-key & associated values.
Why use MongoDB
--------------------
-SQL was invented in the 70's to store data
-MongoDB stores documents or objects
-now a days every one works with objects(python/ruby/java/ets)
-And we need database to persist our objects. then why not store objects directly ?
-embedded documents and arrays reduce need for joins.No joins and No-multidocument transactions.
Database is made of collections
--------------------------------
-made up of Multiple collections
-Created on-the-fly when referenced for the first time.
Collection is tables
------------------------
---------------------------
bind ip=127.0.0.1
port=27017
-mongo is case sensitive and type sensitive
-you can not have duplicate keys,both are distrinct
-documents doesnot maintaining the order
-collection have dynamic schema
